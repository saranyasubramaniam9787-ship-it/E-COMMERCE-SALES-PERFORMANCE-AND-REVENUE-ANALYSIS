# E-COMMERCE-SALES-PERFORMANCE-AND-REVENUE-ANALYSIS
Purpose of the Project was to evaluate business performance and identify patterns in sales, profit, and customer demand using an E-Commerce Sales Dataset in Microsoft Excel. The project focused on transforming raw transactional data into meaningful insights to support data-driven decision-making. Key goals included analysing product-wise, region-wise, and customer-wise performance, tracking sales trends over time, and calculating important business KPIs such as Total Sales, Profit, Profit Margin, Cost per Unit, and Total Revenue.

Results of the Project
• Identified top-performing and low-performing products based on sales and profit.
• Analyzed region-wise and time-based sales trends to understand market demand.
• Evaluated customer segments based on age group and loyalty level.
• Calculated key metrics including Total Sales, Total Revenue, Profit, and Profit Margin.
• Developed dynamic Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts for quick comparison and drill-down analysis.
• Created clear visual summaries and dashboards to help stakeholders understand business performance and improve pricing and product strategies.

Challenges Faced
• Data cleaning was difficult due to missing values, inconsistent formats, and calculation errors.
• Formula validation for profit, margin, and cost per unit required careful verification.
• Designing Pivot Tables with multiple filters (product, region, and date) required proper data structuring.
• Ensuring accuracy while handling large datasets and multiple KPIs was time-consuming.
• Presenting insights in a simple and understandable visual format was a key challenge.
